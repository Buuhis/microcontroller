Designing a computer communication system with a microcontroller via UART as follows:

HARDWARE:

+) 1 external interrupt button for event counting and display on the interface.

+) 8 LEDs corresponding to 8 devices controlled by the interface.

+) Temperature updated on the computer interface every 200 ms.

+) A "run" indicator light for setting the time (0.5s - 5s) on/off from the interface using an interrupt.

INTERFACE:

+) UART-based interface.

+) Control interface for 8 devices.

+) Display interface for counted events.

+) Interface for setting the on/off time of the "run" indicator light.

+) Draw a temperature update chart, with the horizontal axis representing time and the vertical axis representing temperature. In addition to the general requirements, students can design/innovate further for the system.
